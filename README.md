# Deep Learning–Based Sequence Classification in Genomics
The project explores how different nucleotide encoding strategies and neural network architectures affect performance on a binary DNA sequence classification task.

The work is based on and extended from the official tutorial notebook:
A Primer on Deep Learning in Genomics by Abid et al.
